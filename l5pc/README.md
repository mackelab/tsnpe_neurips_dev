Files to run tsnpe on the layer 5 pyramidal cell

### Files that are not uploaded

We did not upload all trained networks and generated simulations for the pyloric network due to their filesize being ~400GB. Please contact michael.deistler@uni-tuebingen.de if you need all of these files. Note that the files that are actually being used to generate the results shown in the paper (such as the neural networks after the final round) are provided [here](https://github.com/mackelab/tsnpe_neurips/tree/main/l5pc/results/p31_4).
